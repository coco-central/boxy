#### Introduction

Boxy is an application instance of Google Blockly, which has a relatively complete configuration. You can use it to develop Blockly quickly.

#### Install

1. **Environment check: Make sure your computer has the latest version of Node.js installed.**
   Boxy is a client-only Web application that uses only Node.js for automatic processing.

2. **Clone repository: Clone this repository to the local.**

   ```
   git clone https://gitee.com/coco-central/boxy.git
   git clone https://github.com/coco-central/boxy.git
   ```

3. **Environment configuration: configure the local development environment.**

   ```
   cd boxy
   ```

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Development service: Start the WebPack DevServer local development service.**
   The construction adopts the development mode and supports thermal overload.

   ```
   npm start
   ```

#### Develop

- **Build: Build based on WebPack.**

  - Development mode: source mapping and DevServer support.

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

  - Production mode: file compression and PWA generation.

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

- **Service: Start the http-server local service.**
  Use

  ```
  npm run server
  ```

- **Watchful waiting: automatic detection of file changes and recompilation.**
  If your development tools can create local services, use this command to perform a hot reload in development.
  The content generated by this command is in `http://localhost:8000/dist/index.html`.

  ```
  npm run watch
  ```

- **Cleanup: Clear packages and builds and reset the cache.**
  Clear the contents of `/dist/` and `/node_modules/` to reset the npm cache.

  ```
  npm run clean
  ```

- **Formatting: standardised project documents.**
  Please run before `commit` to ensure compliance with the code specification.

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```
